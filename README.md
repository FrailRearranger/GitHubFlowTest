# GitHubFlowTest
Test Repo. Exploring how GitHub can be used as part of a git workflow.

This is my first time using GitHub, as opposed to simply using git on the command line. I am learning my way around the website, and exploring GitHub specific features and workflow.

Let's commit the edit to this line on a saparate branch... success.

Now I wonder where I find ```git log``` on the web interface? Oh, there's the SSH address. Maybe I should just do that and not have to use the GitHub web interface? Tempting, however the point of this project is to explore the GitHub interface.
